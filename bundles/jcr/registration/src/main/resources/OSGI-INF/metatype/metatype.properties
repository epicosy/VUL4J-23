 to be registered as services and registers them in an RMI registry under the \
 name specified in the "name" service property.

rmi.port.name = Port Number
rmi.port.description = Port number of the RMI registry to use. The RMI Registrar \

 number is negative, the RMI Registrar is disabled. If this number is higher \
 than 65535, an error message is logged and the RMI Registrar is also \
 disabled. If this number is zero, the system default RMI Registry port 1099 \
 is used.
