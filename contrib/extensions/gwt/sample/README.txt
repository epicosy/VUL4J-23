Apache Sling Google Web Toolkit Sample

This bundle provides a small demonstration of using Google Web Toolkit with
RPC servlet interaction. The application lets you take notes that are persisted
via GWT RPC / Servlet in the JCR repository and displayed via GWT widgets.

To test this sample, build and load the sibling gwt/servlet bundle and this
bundle, and navigate to http://localhost:8888/gwt/demo/index.html
