Apache Sling Scala Scripting Configuration

This bundle provides Apache Sling specific configuration for the Scala 
Scripting Engine. 

Getting Started
===============

This component uses a Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/) build
environment. It requires a Java 5 JDK (or higher) and Maven 
(http://maven.apache.org/) 2.2.1 or later. We recommend to use 
the latest Maven version.

If you have Maven 2 installed, you can compile and
package the jar using the following command:

    mvn package
    
To Install the package in a running Sling instance use:

    mvn sling:install

See the Maven 2 documentation for other build features.
